Hi - I'm Cody Bezik, a graduate student at the University of Chicago in the Pritzer School of Molecular Engineering.  
My research interests are in block copolymer self-assembly, particularly in thin film and confinements relevant 
to semiconductor device fabrication; polymer viscoelasticity, especially in block copolymers for use as thermoplastic elastomers; and free energy sampling methods in molecular simulations, particularly integrated with machine learning techniques.
