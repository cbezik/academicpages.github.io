Hi - I'm Cody Bezik, a graduate student at the University of Chicago in the Pritzer School of Molecular Engineering.  
My research interests are in block copolymer directed self assembly, particularly in thin film and confinements relevant 
to semiconductor device fabrication, as well as advanced free energy sampling methods in molecular simulations.
More recently, I have been interested in studying the assembly of nonlinear block copolymers for use as thermoplastic
elastomers, as well as the application of machine learning to molecular simulation.
