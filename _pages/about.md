Hi - I'm Cody Bezik, a graduate student at the University of Chicago in the Institute for Molecular Engineering.  My research interests are in block copolymer directed self assembly, particularly in thin film and confinements relevant to semiconductor device fabrication, as well as advanced free energy sampling methods in molecular simulations.
