Education
======
* B.S. in Chemical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, 2015
* M.S. in Chemical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, 2015
* Ph.D in Molecular Engineering, University of Chicago, 2021 (expected)

Research experience
======
* 2015-present: Graduate Research Assistant
  * University of Chicago
  * Furthered study of fluctuation-stabilized mesophases formed from nonlinear block copolymers and probed
  the dynamical properties of the resulting networked structures.
  * Studied unique defective structures formed in block copolymer self assembly via simulation previously only
  known to occur experimentally.
  * Performed Monte Carlo simulations in combination with advanced free energy sampling techniques
to understand self-assembly of block copolymers, especially in contact hole geometries.
Elucidated pathways of defect formation and annihilation.
  * Collaborated with experimental partners at IMEC to design combined theoretical and experimental
studies.
  * Participated in the development of the Software Suite for Advanced General Ensemble Simulations
(SSAGES), collaborating on the addition of string methods.

  * Supervisor: Professor Juan de Pablo

* 2012-2015: Research Assistant
  * Case Western Reserve University
  * Prepared and characterized poly-(high internal phase emulsion) foams. Developed understanding
of structure-property relationships, and their variance with composition of the emulsion
precursor.
  * Collaborated with industrial partners at Procter & Gamble to develop new equipment and experimental
stragies.
  * Provided critical advancement of synthesis of poly-(high internal phase emulsion) fibers, a
novel preparation of the material (U.S. Patent No. 9574058)
  * Supervisor: Professor Ice Manas-Zloczower, Professor Donald Feke
