excerpt: 'This paper uses the string method to investigate the mechanism of the formation of through film cylindrical morphologies in cylindrical confinements during block copolymer directed self-assembly.

This paper uses the string method to investigate the mechanism of the formation of through film cylindrical morphologies in cylindrical confinements during block copolymer directed self-assembly.  We find that the assembly process most critically depends on the interaction between the polymer and the confinement sidewall.
