title: "Influence of Homopolymer Addition in Templated Assembly of Cylindrical Block Copolymers"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-03-04-acsnano1
excerpt: 'My contributions to this paper were using Monte Carlo simulations of block copolymer self-assembly to build phase diagrams of block copolymers confined in elliptical templates.  I helped demonstrate that there is a certain window of concentration of homopolymers that stabilize well-separated double cylinder structures in such confinements.  My simulations also helped verify that the homopolymer preferentially segregates to certain regions of the film, lending credence to the experimental hypothesis of the mechanism of the homopolymer stabilization of a doublet structure.'

My contributions to this paper were using Monte Carlo simulations of block copolymer self-assembly to build phase diagrams of block copolymers confined in elliptical templates.  I helped demonstrate that there is a certain window of concentration of homopolymers that stabilize well-separated double cylinder structures in such confinements.  My simulations also helped verify that the homopolymer preferentially segregates to certain regions of the film, lending credence to the experimental hypothesis of the mechanism of the homopolymer stabilization of a doublet structure.
