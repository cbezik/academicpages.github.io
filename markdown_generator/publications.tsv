2018-03-09	Studying the effects of chemistry and geometry on DSA hole-shrink process in three dimensions	Emerging Patterning Technologies 2018	My contributions to this paper include simulations of block copolymer directed self-assembly in the "hole-shrink" process, demonstrating that our coarse-grained simulations predict the same morphologies observed through direct imaging of 3D structures from experiments.

2018-04-10	Mechanisms of Directed Self-Assembly in Cylindrical Hole Confinements	Macromolecules	This paper uses the string method to investigate the mechanism of the formation of through film cylindrical morphologies in cylindrical confinements during block copolymer directed self-assembly.  We find that the assembly process most critically depends on the interaction between the polymer and the confinement sidewall.	Bezik, C. T., Garner, G. P., & de Pablo, J. J. (2018).
