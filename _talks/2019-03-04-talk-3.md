In this talk I introduced preliminary results using molecular simulations to study the phase behavior of the bricks-and-mortar phase formed from a nonlinear block copolymers architecture (prior results can be found in https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.5b01210 and https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.7b01106); the primary innovation of our work is to use three-dimensional particle-based simulations to probe the phase diagram and dynamic properties of the mesophase.
