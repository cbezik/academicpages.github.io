In this talk I elaborated on preliminary results first shown in the prior talk at APS, on using molecular simulations to study the phase behavior of the bricks-and-mortar phase formed from a nonlinear block copolymer architecture; this talk had a primary focus on calculations of mechanical properties (viscosity, dynamic modulus, and Young's modulus especially).
