In this course I shared some of the responsibilities I had held the previous year (collaborating on writing exams, grading homework, holding office hours) while also adding the responsibilities of designing a short series of lectures focusing on thermodynamic cycles and processes, which I also delivered.  Additionally, I helped manage the course's graduate teaching assistant.
